                                <h3>Part 0: The intent of this anti-nft art piece</h3>
                                <p>The content you are currently experiencing is itself a kind of art piece. In the first form, this is created as a web page with specific intents:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Create awareness of the current NFT hype and the problems it creates</li>
                                    <li>To start more conversations about the value of things, art, and the use of the internet</li>
                                    <li>To prove that art and content can be valued and rewarded fairly</li>
                                    <li>To provide a symbol and perhaps create a community for the ones that want to separate themselves from the "NFT Bro" culture.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    This article explains the current state of the global NFT hype going on and some of the problems with it.
                                    We also give some reasons why the current usage of NFTs is against democratic ideology and why it is working against the benefits of a free, information-rich internet where content generation and information sharing is cheap and easy.

                                <h3>Part 1: What are NFTs basically</h3>
                                <p>You will find various technical definitions for NFTs on the internet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token" target="_blank">For example on wikipedia.</a> </p>
                                <p>For simplicity, I will here give a non-technical definition in the context of how NFTs are being "used" today.</p>
                                <p>NFTs are basically one way of using technology to assign ownership to a digitial piece of information. When these digitial pieces of information exist on a blockchain ledger, it allows the ownership proof to be decentralized in theory, so people don't have to trust a single entity to exist for the ownership to remain.</p>
                                <p>An example of <italic>centralized</italic> ownership proof, is when you are buying a game item in a traditional computer game. You only "own" that item in the context of that game, and as long as the game company exist and keep that ownership in their records.</p>
                                <p>Another way a game company could store your ownership of a game item, is if that game item existed on a decentralized shared blockhain, which is not "owned" by any one entity. Even if the game company ceases to exist, your ownership of an item is still recorded on the shared ledger. You move the trust of record-keeping away from the single company to this shared ledger.</p>
                                <p>This decentralized and distributed ownership ledger can have some good practical applications. However, there are a few specific applications that are currently spreading in our culture.</p>
                                <p>Examples of NFT usage today:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Selling intangible "club" memberships, such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club. You can <a href="https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/bored-ape-yatch-club" target="_blank">read about it at Everipedia.</a></li>
                                        <li>Selling digital items that can be used in games.</li>
                                        <li>Selling virtual land in various "Metaverse" experiences.</li>
                                        <li>Selling digital "art" in the form of images, music, videos.</li>
                                        <li>Selling "collectible" sets of said digital art pieces.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>

                                <h3>Part 2: The (overly-simplified) problems with NFTs in the current state</h3>
                                <p>NFTs are problematic for a few reasons. Firstly, they are often used to create exclusive economies in which only a
                                select few can own certain assets. This goes against the principle of a free and open internet, where information and
                                content is cheap and easy to share. Secondly, NFTs can be used to create digital scarcity, which can be used to
                                manipulate prices and create artificial bubbles. Finally, NFTs are often used to create digital assets that have no
                                real-world value. This means that they can be used to scam people and steal their money.</p>

                                <h3>Part 3: The people are divided</h3>
                                <p>There are two camps when it comes to NFTs - those who see the potential and those who see the problems. The people who
                                see the potential believe that NFTs are a way to create new economies and new types of digital assets that have
                                real-world value. The people who see the problems believe that NFTs are a way to create exclusive economies and
                                manipulate prices, and that they have no real-world value - or that the current "value" created is based in the
                                temporary subjective macro-culture of today, and a self-fulfilling prophesy/bubble. This project focuses on shining some light
                            on the "problems", and giving voice to the many who can not fathom why the world has gone "crazy" over something that "has no value".</p>

                                <h3>Part 4: Temporary subjective macro-culture self-fulfilling bubble</h3>
                                <p>When NFTs are used to create scarcity of something that has no reason to be scarce in the first place, they create a temporary subjective macro-culture self-fulfilling bubble.
                                When something is rare and exclusive, people will want it more. This is just the way most of the human brains are programmed.
                                When something is rare and exclusive, it creates a social status for those who own it. Some humans will want to have this as well. This is
                                partially the reason why things like Ferraris, gold and diamonds are so valuable - they are rare and exclusive, because they are priced such that only
                            people with a lot of money can afford it.</p>
                                <p>Physical items have real-world <strong>reasons</strong> to be limited and scarce. It is because it actually requires resources, time and labor to create each
                                individual item, such as a single Ferrari. Digital items - however - does not require a much of anything to duplicate. And so it goes against the nature of digital benefits to
                            create a limitation in the duplication of digital resources, simply to satisfy the human brain's desire for obtaining something scarce.</p>
                            <p>The problem with this is that it creates an artificial value. When something is rare and exclusive, people will pay more
                                for it than it is "worth". This is because they want to be a part of the exclusive group. This is what is happening with
                                NFTs. People are paying more for them than they are worth, because they want to be a part of the exclusive group that
                                owns them.</p>

                                <h3>Part 5: The term "value" is already hard to define</h3>
                                <p>The term "value" is already hard to define. This is because it is subjective. What one person may see as valuable,
                                another person may not. This is because our values are shaped by our culture, upbringing and experiences. This means
                                that the value of an NFT is also subjective. What one person may see as valuable, another person may not. In the debates
                                involving NFTs, the term "value" is being used in various ways on both sides of the argument, but often people are not
                                agreeing on what type of value they refer to - intrinsic, extrinsic or subjective.</p>

                                <h3>Part 6: The value of hard-work art and auto-generated "art"</h3>
                                <p>Some people value art because it has been created by another human, who they respect or to whom they attribute some
                                value. Therefore they also attribute some kind of value to the artwork that this person has created. People can also
                                attribute value to an artwork without knowing who has created it. In this case, it could be because the artwork produces
                                specific feelings, thoughts or emotions within the person experiencing it. However, this is different for each
                                individual and the specific artwork should be valued differently depending on the person experiencing it.</p>
                                <p>Some people also value artwork that is auto-generated, without any input from a human. This is because they see it as a
                                representation of the current state of technology and art. They believe that it is a new form of art that has not been
                                explored before and that it has a lot of potential. These are valid statements about the technology, but does not mean
                                that specific generated pieces have much value in and of themselves. They are representations of the technology, but the
                                value of these representations come from the subjective interpretation of the person experiencing it, similar to
                                traditional analogue art.</p>
                                <p>Today, a person can use already-created software to auto-generate 10.000 unique variations of a "simple" drawing or
                                photograph, and sell a representation (NFT) of each individual image for an arbitrary amount of money. This is an
                                example of how something that (often) has no intrinsic value can be given value through the act of selling it. People
                                are buying these NFTs for different reasons, but a lot of people are under the impression that these have "a lot of
                                value", or "will increase in value". A lot of people are simply gambling on the "value" of these NFTs, and because so
                                many are doing this, it has created an artificial bubble.</p>

                                    In opposition to NFTs, this symbol does not come in limited editions. It exists not on the blockchain, but in our spirits.
                                    Its value will become greater the more people download it and share it. <strong>You</strong> determine it's value.
                                    <strong>You</strong> will set it's price.

                                    You are <strong>free</strong> to copy/download and use the symbol as you want.
                                    No royalties, no copyright attached. But of course, if you mis-use it, you might hurt the project. If you agree with
                                    this project, please use it responsibly. Similar to the arguments of the over-expensive NFTs, you can feel a kind of
                                    "group membership" by using this symbol. It is a symbol of membership of this art/project/movement. The more people who
                                    decide to use it, the more powerful it becomes.
                                    You will yourself attribute value to this symbol, depending on how many are using it. Use as an avatar, have it as a
                                    background on your phone or computer. Print it out and put it on your wall, or post it on your blog, or talk about
                                    it on your channel. Do what you want, but do it in the intended spirit of this project and be part of a group of humans
                                    who want to think sensibly and reasonably around NFTs, technology and the future of humanity.
